# Tic Tac Toe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It's a [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#complex-features-become-simple) to learn the techniques that are fundamental to building any React app and will give you a deep understanding of React.

## How To Play
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Players take turns putting their marks (X or O) alternately in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of of her marks in a row (up, down, across, diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

## Game Features
- interactive
- indicates whose turn is it
- indicates when a player has won the game
- stores game history as the game progresses
- allows players to review the game's history and see previous versions of the game board

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
